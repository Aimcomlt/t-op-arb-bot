# T-OP-Arb-Bot
A modular, optimized arbitrage engine focused on backend precision and future-ready architecture.

# T-OP-Arb-Bot — Turbo-Optimized Arbitrage Bot

**Real-time, modular DeFi arbitrage detection and execution system**  
Powered by the ABIE Core (Arbitrage Bot Intelligent Engine)

---

## 🚀 Overview

T-OP-Arb-Bot is a TypeScript-based, event-driven backend built to scan for profitable arbitrage opportunities across decentralized exchanges like **Uniswap** and **Sushiswap**. It features real-time Sync event listeners, ABI-independent transaction simulation, slippage-aware strategy building, and Flashbots-secure trade execution.

## 🧠 ABIE — Arbitrage Bot Intelligent Engine

**ABIE** is the broadcast and decision-making core of the system — the "eyes" of the bot. It detects DeFi behaviors, formulates them into actionable strategies, and broadcasts results to the frontend or command listeners.

### ABIE Features:
- WebSocket broadcast of opportunities, execution results, and system logs
- Command intake from frontend/admin dashboard (e.g., adjust slippage in real-time)
- Modular event handlers for post-sync, post-trade, and discrepancy analysis
